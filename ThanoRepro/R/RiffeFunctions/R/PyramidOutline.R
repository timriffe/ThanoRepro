#' @title PyramidOutline draws a population pyramid as a single polygon
#' 
#' @description This function rescales and positions a population pyramid according to the convention of having males on the left and females on the right, and using discrete age groups. Ages are assumed to be in single-years intervals and to start at age 0. A plot device must already be open.
#' 
#' @param males vector of male population counts or fractions
#' @param females vector of male population counts or fractions
#' @param scale the total population, for purposes of plotting. For proportions in each age group, set to 1.
#' @param x the x position of the middle of the pyramid
#' @param y the y position of the bottom of the pyramid
#' @param ... arguments passed to \code{polygon()}.
#' 
#' @export
#' 
#' @return function called primarily for its graphical side effects, although a list of x and y coordinates is invisibly returned.
