\title{Thano redistribute age an age-classified vector into an age-remaining years cross-classified matrix}
\usage{
Thano(Px, dx, stagger = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Px}{any single-year age-classified vector of data. Age classes must align with those of \code{dx} starting at 0.}

\item{dx}{single-age density column of the lifetable. Age classes must align with those of \code{Px} starting at 0.}
}
\description{
A discrete approximation of the thanatological redistribution formula. If \code{length(Px) != length(dx)}, we pad out the shorter of the two with 0s.
